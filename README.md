Hello there !!

This is my first fps game . The game doesnot have save mode
There a lot of bugs that can be cleared. You can download this package 
And modify however you want . The game contains 8 different levels .
That must be completed with one go. Any modifications or bug clearance is appreciated
 - Thank you
